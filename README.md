# Hi, I'm Matthew Jones 👋

**Full Stack Engineer & Designer** | Vancouver, BC 🇨🇦

I'm obsessed with where technical excellence meets refined design. Building thoughtful digital products that blend cutting-edge technology with human-centered experiences.

## What I'm About

Product-focused engineer with entrepreneurial DNA. I build systems that scale, interfaces that breathe, and products that matter. From OCaml's functional elegance to React's component paradigms, I choose tools that respect both developer experience and user outcomes.

## Current Focus

### 🚀 Stalker
*Borderline creepy sales intelligence* - Currently in beta, revolutionizing how sales teams gather and leverage prospect insights.

### 💡 Open to New Projects
Fixed-rate engagements. Clear scope. Delivered fast. I leverage AI tools for 10x efficiency while maintaining the judgment and business acumen that only human expertise provides.

## Technical Philosophy

> "Weniger, aber besser" - Less, but better

Good code, like good design, is obvious in its simplicity and transparent in its function. Strong advocate for AI-enhanced development - I see LLMs not as replacements but as amplifiers of human creativity.
